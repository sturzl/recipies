# Pizza Dough
- 1.5 hrs
- 2 small pizzas (~13 in)


## Ingredients

- 3 1/2 to 4 cups flour (see notes)
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 envelope instant dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/2 cups water, 110ยบ F (see notes)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Process
- Put bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in a bowl and combine.
- Add the water and oil. Mix until the dough forms a ball.
  - If the dough is sticky, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a solid ball.
  - If the dough is dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time.
- Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth, firm ball.
- Grease a large bowl and add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
- On a lightly floured surface divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.
- Roll out dough or oil lightly, wrap in 2 layers of plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 months.

## Notes
- Bread flour will  make a crisper crust. Substitute all-purpose flour for a chewier crust.
- To approximate 110ยบ F: Boil water, measure into a bowl and wait about 7 minues.
